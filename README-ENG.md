This is just a prototype. It isnt near to be finished.

## Things to do

* Fully implement www.animefenix.com, adding a way to select specific servers (right now it only scraps the first in an array of servers; if that first server is Mega, the scraping doesnt works)
* (in the future) Change the scraping server to https://animeonline1.ninja, as it has more options.


## Dependencies

### Essential
```
grep
